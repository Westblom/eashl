## SKLaravel

Starter-Kit Laravel is made with [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/docs) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
It also includes [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

The reason why I made this, is to make it easy to initialize a project that needs some kind of article/user management.
The current version of sklaravel runs on Laravel 4.2, Bootstrap 3.1.1 and Font Awesome 4.1.

##  Documentation

Documentation for the Laravel framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
For Bootstrap CSS or anything else, see [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/).
